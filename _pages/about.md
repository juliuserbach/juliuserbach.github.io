I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Center for Learning Systems under the supervision of Prof. Konrad Schindler and Prof. Bernt Schiele.
I am interested in the use of Probabilistic Generative Models like Diffusion Models for computational photography and 3D modeling. Particularly, I want to investigate how to efficiently re-use priors which are incorporated in Foundation models for new applications like inverse problems.
